# Hello! You can see a little bit about me on my personal read me.
This was a project I made one afternoon cause I was bored. My current laser tag arena (Laser Strike) uses delta strike and last time I went in I personaly didn't like the ui. So I desided to fix that.

You can take any of these ideas (just email or something about which ones are good and which ones you hate)  :). 
The design was made in Penpot (https://penpot.app/) and the original file will be in this repo. 

Ill also put in each one of the images so you dont have to download anything ;) this will also inclute a little commentary on how I think it could improve etc.

(Im currently 17 and unemployed ;) if you like this im happy to talk about this on a video call or something) 

Have a wonderful day! - Published under unlisence softwhare but basicly I dont care what you do with it :) some warning or attribution is always nice tho! And a lil bit of money would be even better!

Without further adu lets begin!

P.S. Sorry in advance about the weird formatting.

# Welcome Screen
The first thing a player will see when they put on the vest.

Not much to say here, the pfp images are the ones I use for beatsaber and I had them in a square ratio so they went in. Just made to be simple. The gradiant for the signed in is based off the image.

# Main Menu - In Game
When a player gets into a game this is what they will see.

Uses my base template:

Most of it should be self explanitory for the above. 

## Swapping power up menu

If a player wants to chose a new powerup to work towards for every kill here is where they do it (middle button on menu bar)

The reason I made the signed in one empty is that I thought if there is a lot of differant powerups it would be cool if the member was able to swap them at a kiosk or online or something.

## Settings menu

I didn't know what to put in the settings menu just knew that one might be useful so...

## Getting Killed

When a player gets killed they should know about it, here's what I got...

| Killer not signed in | Killer signed in |
| -- | -- |
| ![Killed by a signed out player](https://github.com/syntheticsam/deltastrikeui/blob/main/Killed%20By%20Signed%20Out.png?raw=true) | ![Killed by a signed in player](https://github.com/syntheticsam/deltastrikeui/blob/main/Killed%20By%20Signed%20In.png?raw=true) |

Should be self explanitory enough. And please remove gun overheating. Please. Its not cool.

## Game over

At the end of the game this would show up.

As I was writing this I realised that I possibly could have told the user what place they came and if they were most trigger happy etc. but ah well.

# Closing thoughts

There is probibly some things I missed in this and sorry if I did.

Here were my closing thoughts as I was making this (deseptively named intro):

**And finaly please remove overheating. Thank you.**
