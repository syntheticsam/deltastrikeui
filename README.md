# Hello! You can see a little bit about me on my personal read me.
This was a project I made one afternoon cause I was bored. My current laser tag arena (Laser Strike) uses delta strike and last time I went in I personaly didn't like the ui. So I desided to fix that.

You can take any of these ideas (just email or something about which ones are good and which ones you hate)  :). 
The design was made in Penpot (https://penpot.app/) and the original file will be in this repo. 

Ill also put in each one of the images so you dont have to download anything ;) this will also inclute a little commentary on how I think it could improve etc.

(Im currently 17 and unemployed ;) if you like this im happy to talk about this on a video call or something) 

Have a wonderful day!
